  |   G-00, and join forces with Gooigi to overcome the puzzling            |
  |   contraptions and mischievous boss on each themed floor. And that's    |
  |   just the Last Resort. Enter the ScareScraper for 8-player local       |
  |   wireless or online co-op gameplay.                                    |

  |   See if you can defeat all the ghosts, rescue all the toads, or        |
  |   clear other objectives before time runs out...in the ScareScraper!    |
  |   And for more mini-game madness, compete on teams at the ScreamPark!   |
  |   Whether you play with friends or wander the hotel alone, you'll be    |
  |   sucked in by the atmospheric music and ghoulish décor of every        |
  |   cobwebby corner you explore. Why not take in the cinematic sights     |
  |   and sounds with a friend? In the main adventure, you and a friend     |

  |   overcome obstacles he can't tackle alone. Never hurts to have a       |
  |   friend in this hotel; it may not be very spooky, but Luigi begs to    |
  |   differ!                                                               |
